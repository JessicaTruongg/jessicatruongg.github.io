I am currently a third year computer science student at the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular Molecular and Microbial Biology. I hope to be able to gain experience in this field because it aligns with my career goals and personal values. I hope to be able to contribute to solving problems and drive innovation. I believe that overcoming new challenges promotes personal and career development as it allows me to continuously learn and be able adapt to changing environments. I value innovation because it solves others problems, a meaningful and impactful change that not only provides a sense of fulfillment but also a source of motivation for me to continuously improve and do better. In my down time I enjoy travelling to various places enjoying the food and culture that each country has to offer.
