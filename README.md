## About me 
I am currently a third year computer science student at the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular Molecular and Microbial Biology. I hope to be able to gain experience in this field because it aligns with my career goals and personal values. I hope to be able to contribute to a team that solves problems and drives innovation. I believe that overcoming new challenges promotes personal and career development as it allows me to continuously learn and be able adapt to changing environments. I value innovation because it solves others problems, a meaningful and impactful change that not only provides a sense of fulfillment but also a source of motivation for me to continuously improve and do better. In my down time I enjoy travelling to various places enjoying the food and culture that they have to offer. Additionally, in doing so, it allows me to expand my knowledge and see things in different perspectives. 


## Projects

### Optimanage
- A management software with a database for a Hula franchise store that will be used by employees and
management. This software will allow management to be able to plan for each employee’s schedule. This software will allow for employees to input their availability on a main calendar which allows for management to have a complete visual overview of all employee’s availability for scheduling purposes.

### Kaggle Competition
- Participated in a Kaggle competition that contained various datasets with sensor readings over time of different movements for instance, walking, standing, running, etc. The created model must be able to correctly classify different movement types. 
For this competition, I used combined machine learning models such as random forest and bootstrap with normalization techniques through python numpy and pandas to generate a model with 70% accuracy.<https://github.com/JessicaTruongg/Movement-Classification>

### Classifying Heart Sounds Using Machine Learning -- in progress
- Using machine learning techniques, specifically cluster-based classification on a dataset with a variety of heart sounds
to determine if an individual has an irregularity in heart sound pattern to be able to detect illness/diseases.

### Personal Planner
- Used Java and JavaFX to create a personal planner with other group members through git that allows the
user to customize their schedule and be able to visualize it. The user is able to modify existing plans, create new plans, set priorities to the plans based on a rating from 1 to 5 and be able to categorize the plans. The program was tested using JUnit 5 to ensure correctness and identify possible issues/errors.

### Robot Gate Game
- Used python to create a game where the objective was to ensure all robots pass through a gate without
hitting the walls of the map where each directional command would move all robots at the same time. This game was created as an assignment from class using some code provided by the course.
